## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a refined blue (#2E86AB), mirroring professionalism and trust. This should cover most buttons.
- Background color: Apply an off-white (#F0F4F8), providing a clean and modern foundation.
- Accent color: Introduce a muted gold (#A9927D), bringing an element of sophistication to headers.
- Font pairing: Use 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines to give a sense of modern elegance, complemented by 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability.
- Employ clean, minimalist icons in the same hue as the accent color for services and social media links, maintaining a consistent visual theme.
- Implement a grid-based layout, maximizing whitespace and arranging elements strategically to guide the user through the content logically.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations, such as fade-ins and smooth scrolling, to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the design.
